== Host Aggregates

* Besides Availability Zones (AZ), compute nodes can also be logically grouped into Host Aggregates

* Host Aggregates have meta-data to tag groups of compute nodes e.g. we can group nodes with `GPU`  to one Host Aggregate

* Compute nodes can be put into Host Aggregate and Availability Zone at the same time

* Host Aggregate has no conflict with Availability Zone.

* One compute node can be put into more than one Host Aggregates

* Host Aggregate is visible only to admin,

* For end-user host aggregate configuration can be exposed by creating customized `flavor` with `Host Aggregate meta-data` property.
