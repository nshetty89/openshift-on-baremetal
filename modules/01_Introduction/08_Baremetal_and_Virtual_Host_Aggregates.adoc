== Host Aggregate Configuration

What Nova Scheduler processes a server create request, it compares the flavor properties with the host aggregates metadata and selects a suitable host

* To differentiate KVM and Ironic nodes, create two host aggregates
** For example, *baremetal-hosts* and *virtual-hosts*

* Add _compute_ nodes for virtual instances to the *virtual-hosts* aggregate
* Add _controller_ nodes to the *baremetal-hosts* aggregate

** By default, only controller nodes have the _NovaIronic_ service
** If there is composable role with the _NovaIronic_ service, add those nodes also to the *baremetal-hosts* aggregate
