== Host Aggregate Configuration for OpenStack Hybrid Node Cluster

* To Separate the hosts for `Virtual` and `Baremetal`, create two hosts aggregate (eg:baremetal-hosts and virtual-hosts)

 When an instance is provisioned, Computeâ€™s scheduler compares `properties on the flavor` with the properties assigned to `host aggregates`, and ensures that the instance is provisioned in the correct aggregate

* Add all `Compute Hosts` for virtual instances to the  aggregate for the virtual hosts

* Add all `controller` hosts to the  aggregate for the baremetal hosts

NOTE: If there is  composable role with the `NovaIronic service`, add all the nodes with the service to  the baremetal-hosts aggregate

By default, only the controller nodes have the `NovaIronic` service
