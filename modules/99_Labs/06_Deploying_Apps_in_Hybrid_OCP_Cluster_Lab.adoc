= Red Hat Tech Exchange 2018 - Using OpenStack director to provision OpenShift on bare metal

**Scenario:1**

== Deploying Application in  hybrid cluster using `nodeSelector` specification

Assume a scenario where you required a multi-tier application, in which each of the tiers needs a particular type of compute node due to its resource utilization/security patterns.

In this lab, we have the `Deployment Configuration.`  manifest for a two-tier application (Word Press). The customer wishes to deploy the `pods` of the front tier  (PHP) into a more flexible and horizontally scalable `virtual compute nodes`, whereas the `db` tier pods to a high capacity `baremetal` compute node.

We have the deployment manifest for both the tiers are available in `/root` of the bastion node.

.You may verify the `node` selector specification in both `Deployment Configuration (dc)` manifests.

[%nowrap]
----
[root@ocp-bastion ~]# view frontend-app.yaml
----
. Search for the `nodeSelector` spec of the `front tier` manifest
+
[%nowrap]
----
...
        nodeSelector:
          type: "vm"
...
----
.View  the `nodeSelector` in  the db tier manifest.

[%nowrap]
----
[root@ocp-bastion ~]# vi mysql.yaml
----
. Search for the `nodeSelector` spec. of the `db tier` manifest
+
[%nowrap]
----
...
        nodeSelector:
          type: "bm"
...
----
. Create a `project` for the application
+
[%nowrap]
----
[root@ocp-bastion ~]# oc new-project node-selector-demo
----
. Since the word press containers are running with `root` privilege, we need to add additional security privilege to the `default` service account of the project.
+
[%nowrap]
----
[root@ocp-bastion ~]# oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z default  -n node-selector-demo
----
. Create the front tier Deployment Configuration using the `frontend-app.yaml` manifest.
+
[%nowrap]
----
[root@ocp-bastion ~]# oc create -f  frontend-app.yaml
----
.Expected Output
+
[%nowrap]
----
imagestream.image.openshift.io "wordpress" created
deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io "wordpress" created
service "wordpress" created
----

. Create the `db tier` Deployment Configuration using the `mysql.yaml` manifest.

[%nowrap]
----
[root@ocp-bastion ~]# oc create -f  mysql.yaml
----
.Expected Output
+
[%nowrap]
----
imagestream.image.openshift.io "db" created
deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io "db" created
----
. You may verify the `pod` creation of the respective tiers in the selected nodes as per the `nodeSelector` specification.

----
You may note that as per the  Application requirement, `front tier`  pods deployed on the virtual instance `ocp-node01` and `db` tier pods deployed on baremetal node `ocp-node02`.

**Scenario:2** (Optional)

=== Label OpenShift nodes to the correct environment
. Connect to `ocp-master01` node

You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:

    oc new-app centos/ruby-22-centos7~https://github.com/openshift/ruby-ex.git

to build a new example application in Ruby.

    Ruby 2.2
    --------
    Ruby 2.2 available as container is a base platform for building and running various Ruby 2.2 applications and frameworks. Ruby is the interpreted scripting language for quick and easy object-oriented programming. It has many features to process text files and to do system management tasks (as in Perl). It is simple, straight-forward, and extensible.

    Tags: builder, ruby, ruby22

    * An image stream will be created as "ruby-22-centos7:latest" that will track the source image
    * A source build using source code from https://github.com/openshift/ruby-ex.git will be created
      * The resulting image will be pushed to image stream "ruby-ex:latest"
      * Every time "ruby-22-centos7:latest" changes a new build will be triggered
    * This image will be deployed in deployment config "ruby-ex"
    * Port 8080/tcp will be load balanced by service "ruby-ex"
