= Red Hat Tech Exchange 2018 - Using OpenStack director to provision OpenShift on bare metal

== Deploying applications in different OpenShift environments.

In this lab we will create a project where the applications inside will be hosted on `ocp-node01`, the Virtual Machine.
Another project will host production applications and the containers will run on `ocp-node02`, the baremetal node.

=== Label OpenShift nodes to the correct environment
. Connect to `ocp-master01` node

----
(overcloud) [stack@undercloud ~]$ ssh cloud-user@192.0.3.16

=== Create a development project and deploy an application inside
This project will use the node selector using the previous label created to use the environment development.

Now using project "test-project-dev" on server "https://console.openshift.example.com:8443".

You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:

    oc new-app centos/ruby-22-centos7~https://github.com/openshift/ruby-ex.git

to build a new example application in Ruby.

--> Found Docker image e42d0dc (3 months old) from Docker Hub for "centos/ruby-22-centos7"

    Ruby 2.2
    --------
    Ruby 2.2 available as container is a base platform for building and running various Ruby 2.2 applications and frameworks. Ruby is the interpreted scripting language for quick and easy object-oriented programming. It has many features to process text files and to do system management tasks (as in Perl). It is simple, straight-forward, and extensible.

    Tags: builder, ruby, ruby22

    * An image stream will be created as "ruby-22-centos7:latest" that will track the source image
    * A source build using source code from https://github.com/openshift/ruby-ex.git will be created
      * The resulting image will be pushed to image stream "ruby-ex:latest"
      * Every time "ruby-22-centos7:latest" changes a new build will be triggered
    * This image will be deployed in deployment config "ruby-ex"
    * Port 8080/tcp will be load balanced by service "ruby-ex"
      * Other containers can access this service through the hostname "ruby-ex"
